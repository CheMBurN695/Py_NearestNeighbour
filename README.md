# Package Delivery System ðŸšš  

This project implements an optimized package delivery system. The system leverages greedy algorithms and nearest neighbor heuristics to optimize package delivery routes, manage truck schedules, and ensure that time-sensitive packages are delivered within their deadlines.  

## Features  
- **Optimal Truck Loading**:  
  Distributes packages among three trucks while adhering to constraints such as priority deadlines and capacity limits.  
- **Dynamic Routing**:  
  Uses a nearest neighbor algorithm to minimize the mileage during delivery while ensuring efficient route traversal.  
- **Real-Time Status Tracking**:  
  Allows users to check the delivery status of packages (`At Hub`, `En Route`, or `Delivered`) at any given time.  
- **Deadline Monitoring**:  
  Automatically flags packages that breach delivery deadlines.  
- **Interactive User Interface**:  
  View total truck mileage or package delivery statuses at specified times.
